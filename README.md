## Summary Table of MET Assignments

| **Category**                                   | **Example Exercises**                                            | **MET Range** | **Justification / Sources**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Static Core Exercises**                      | Planks, isometric abdominal holds                                | 2.5–3.0       | Low oxygen consumption; similar to “light calisthenics”. See the [Compendium of Physical Activities](https://pacompendium.com/conditioning-exercise/) and [Wikipedia’s MET page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task).                         |
| **Basic Dynamic Ab Exercises**                 | Standard crunches, sit-ups                                       | 2.8–3.0       | Typical steady ab movements; consistent with low-effort calisthenics. Reference the [Fitness Volt ab calorie calculator](https://fitnessvolt.com/calories-burned-abdominal-exercises/).                                                                                       |
| **Moderate Dynamic Core Exercises**            | Banded crunches, decline band press sit-ups, seated twists         | 3.8–4.0       | Added resistance or decline mechanics increase energy expenditure. See entries in the [Compendium of Physical Activities](https://pacompendium.com/conditioning-exercise/) and [Healthline’s explanation of METs](https://www.healthline.com/health/what-are-mets).           |
| **Vigorous Core Exercises**                    | Plank jacks, hanging knee tucks                                  | 5.0–7.0       | These dynamic, plyometric movements have a higher cardiorespiratory demand. Similar vigorous calisthenics are rated in the [Compendium of Physical Activities](https://pacompendium.com/conditioning-exercise/).                                                           |
| **Compound Full‑Body/Core‑Intensive Exercises** | Squat‑Clean‑Alternating‑Press Complex, Weighted Burpee to Pike       | 7.0–8.0       | Multi‑joint, explosive movements recruit large muscle groups and require high core stabilization. Refer to the [Compendium of Physical Activities](https://pacompendium.com/conditioning-exercise/) and [Wikipedia’s MET page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task). |
